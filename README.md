# MinorProject-Lung-Cancer-Detection-II
In this project I have used KNN &amp; decision tree algorithms to predict the accuracy of  cancer. In this project I have used scikit-learn libraries like sklearn and pandas to predict and classify the dataset of lung cancer patients. Slicing the dataset and feature scaling options are used to trainthe dataset. After that I have used a confusion matrix , f1 score and accuracy score to predict the accuracy of the result.
